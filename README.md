Alternate firmware for ANT-BMS display units

This repository is my attempt at re-programming my ANT-BMS display unit which is on an electric motorcycle.  My goals are 
1. Have the display turn on automatically when power is applied (currently you have to push one of the buttons to start it)
1. Have the default display be something similar to the Volts/Amps page which shows battery voltage and current in large text (instead of the ugly and useless speedometer page).

Note: The power supply is actually started in hardware by the top button, so you need to put a jumper on the PCB to accomplish item 1.  If you need to know how to do this, send me a photo of your PCB and I will mark it up showing where the jumper goes, and post the image for everyone to use.
